weatherapp
==========

This is a weather app I made for Verold!  This app uses a PHP script to 
download weather data from Environment Canada.

Requierments 
==========

If you are are going to run the application, the SimpleXML library for PHP
must be installed. 

Also, this app is meant to run on an apache webserver with the mod\_rewrite
engine enabled.

Installation
==========

Install the "weather" directory in the root of your web
server and browse to /weather to see it in action.

If you are unable to set it up, don't worry! I will be bringing a working
copy into the Verold office. The working copy is on my netbook.
